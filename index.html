 <p>My name is Manuel Swingler and I am a Senior Computer Engineering major. I have a passion for
    video game creation and creation of websites from both the back end and the front end.
    I have found that they have a similar process for construction and design process. Websites
    can be very in depth. I am from Prince Georges County Maryland and am 21 years old. I am hopeful
    for the future in this class teaching me to make a living website that I am able to customize to 
    my liking.
